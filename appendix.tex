\chapter{Detailed Test Results}

This chapter shows detailed state changes of the 17 tests conducted on the system in the following table. In the tables, the column ``run\#'' corresponds to the column ``number'' in Table~\ref{table:compare-epa-all}. That is to say, the details of the test with ``number = k'' in Table~\ref{table:compare-epa-all} are shown in the table with ``run\# = k'' in this chapter. The column ``time'' in the table indicate timesteps in the Planstep and Emotion Updater, where ``time = 0'' means at the time of initialization. The column ``behav-prop.'' in the tables use the definition of behaviours shown in column ``Representation Number used in the Updater'' in Table~\ref{table:area-action}, and the column of ``ps\_beliefs'' uses the definition of plansteps shown Table~\ref{table:heuristic-policy}. Finally, the columns ``prompt-prop.'' in the table uses the definition of prompts shown in column ``Representation number in Prompt-Selector'' in Table~\ref{table:prompt-number-def}. If ``prompt-epa = 0'', then it means that there was no actual prompt displayed at that timestep. No matter whether a prompt was displayed or not at a timestep, the value of ``prompt-epa'' at that timestep was produced by the updater based on the belief states at that time, and thus is included in calculating the mean of prompt-epa's for that run. For all these tests, the parameter settings as shown in Table~\ref{table:param-setting} were used.
